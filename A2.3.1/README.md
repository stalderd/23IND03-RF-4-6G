# A2.3.1

VSL, CMI, LNE, METAS, TUBITAK and PTB will apply novel methods to characterise the linearity of VNA receivers of different VNA models. The method consists in establishing a linear scale by repeated comparison of receivers in a VNA. VSL and METAS will develop the necessary software to automate the process and they will vary parameters to investigate the stability and consistency of the method.

## METAS VNA Tools VNA Linearity Measurement Script

The script called [StepAttScriptedMeasurements_01.py](METAS_VNA_Tools_VNA_Linearity_Measurement_Script/StepAttScriptedMeasurements_01.py) takes the raw measurements.

## METAS VNA Tools Extender Linearity Measurement Script

The script called [LinMeasExtender_ScriptedMeasurements_Transmission.py](METAS_VNA_Tools_Extender_Linearity_Measurement_Script/LinMeasExtender_ScriptedMeasurements_Transmission.py) takes the raw measurements.
