# A2.3.1

VSL, CMI, LNE, METAS, TUBITAK and PTB will apply novel methods to characterise the linearity of VNA receivers of different VNA models. The method consists in establishing a linear scale by repeated comparison of receivers in a VNA. VSL and METAS will develop the necessary software to automate the process and they will vary parameters to investigate the stability and consistency of the method.
